# Comparison-Based-Sorting-Algorithms
In this project, the following comparison – based sorting algorithms are implemented. Performance is observed for different input sizes. 
1. Insertion sort  
2. Merge sort  
3. Heapsort [vector based, and insert one item at a time] 
4. In-place quicksort (any random item or the first or the last item of your input can be pivot)
5. Modified quicksort  • Use median-of-three as pivot • For small sub-problem of size ≤ 10, must use insertion sort
